# Real-Time News Feed App

This is a demo project that simulates a real-time news feed using WebSocket. The application shows how news data would be displayed in real-time if it were being fetched from a live news source.

## Features:
- Real-time news updates via WebSockets
- Supports news categories like Tech, Sports, Business, etc.
- Automatically subscribes and filters news based on the selected category.

**Note:**  
Since this is a demo project, no live news data is being sent. The app is designed to handle real-time data when available. The news is simulated every few seconds, and if no data is available, the message "No news available." will be displayed.
